            <h2>My Journey as a Software Engineering Student</h2><br>

              <h3>Introduction: Why Software Engineering?</h3>
              <p>
                When I first enrolled at <span class="colored">Ontario Tech University,</span> I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what being a software engineer really meant.
                I knew I liked tech, and I was curious about how the apps and tools we use every day were built.
                But what I didn‚Äôt know was that this journey would push me to think deeper, fail harder, and grow faster than I ever expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, entering my third year, I can say with confidence that <strong>learning to code isn‚Äôt just about syntax</strong> ‚Äî it‚Äôs about problem-solving,
                collaboration, communication, and yes, getting stuck (a lot).
              </p><br>
              
              <h3>The First Real Win: Java Cashier Receipt Printer</h3>
              <p>
                One of my first projects that made me feel like a ‚Äúreal‚Äù developer was a <strong>Cashier Receipt Printer</strong> built in Java.
                It required clean object-oriented design, accurate handling of totals, and flexibility for future features.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ran into a bug where totals were miscalculating. It took hours of debugging, but in the process, I learned to trust my tools and logic.
                That project taught me how important <strong>structure, planning, and debugging</strong> really are.
              </p><br>

              <h3>Leading a Team: The Soccer League Database System</h3>
              <p>
                As team lead for our <strong>Soccer League DBMS</strong> project, I worked with Oracle SQL, shell scripting, and Java GUIs.
                My biggest role? Bringing the pieces together and leading collaboration.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Normalized the schema to BCNF</li>
                <li>Built CLI workflows with shell scripts</li>
                <li>Integrated a GUI for user interaction</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The real challenge was integration. This project taught me that <strong>good code is only half the battle ‚Äî team communication is the other half</strong>.
              </p><br>

              <h3>Designing for Real People: Restaurant Website</h3>
              <p>
                Next came a full-stack <strong>Restaurant Website</strong> using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma. We also used SQL to manage dynamic content.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the first time, I had to think like a user. Would the layout make sense? Was it mobile-friendly? Could someone find the menu easily?
              </p>
              <p>
                This taught me that <strong>frontend design and backend logic must work hand in hand</strong> ‚Äî and that user experience (UX) matters as much as the code.
              </p><br>

              <h3>Beyond Classrooms: Teaching Code at Camp</h3>
              <p>
                As a <strong>Camp Coordinator</strong>, I taught Java and C++ to children in my community. This experience helped me:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Communicate clearly and patiently</li>
                <li>Break down complex concepts for beginners</li>
                <li>Appreciate the joy of helping others learn</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Teaching made me a better developer and gave me a sense of purpose I hadn‚Äôt expected.
              </p><br>

              <h3>Real-World Application: Web Developer Internship</h3>
              <p>
                During my internship at <strong>My Homework Rewards</strong>, I helped build and deploy educational content with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                I got hands-on experience with version control, responsive design, and real-time feedback from users. It made development feel meaningful.
              </p><br>

              <h3>Key Lessons I‚Äôve Learned (So Far)</h3>

              <h3>‚úÖ 1. Failure is Part of the Process</h3>
              <p>
                Every bug and crash taught me something. Failure isn‚Äôt the end ‚Äî it‚Äôs part of the path forward.
              </p>

              <h3>‚úÖ 2. Soft Skills Matter</h3>
              <p>
                Collaboration, communication, and project leadership are just as important as technical know-how.
              </p>

              <h3>‚úÖ 3. Projects Speak Louder Than Grades</h3>
              <p>
                Real growth comes from building ‚Äî not just from passing exams.
              </p><br>

              <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
              <p>
                My journey so far has been shaped by code, collaboration, and continuous learning.
                I‚Äôve built, broken, and rebuilt ‚Äî and I‚Äôm just getting started.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're beginning your own journey, I encourage you: <strong>start building, keep learning, and don‚Äôt be afraid to fail</strong>.
