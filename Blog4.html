          <h2>Co-Founding a Community Soccer League</h2><br>

          <h3>How It Started</h3>
          <p>
            Last year, I co-founded something that had nothing to do with lines of code ‚Äî but everything to do with <strong>leadership, teamwork, and giving back</strong>.
            Alongside <strong>my brother and his friend</strong>, we launched our own <strong>community soccer league</strong> for local youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea came from a simple goal: give kids in our neighborhood a structured, exciting way to stay active and have fun during the summer.
            We started with limited equipment, a few connections, and a lot of ambition.
          </p><br>

          <h3>The First Year: Learning As We Played</h3>
          <p>
            Our inaugural season was in the summer of 2024. We hosted both <strong>Junior (Grades 1‚Äì6)</strong> and <strong>Senior (Grades 7‚Äì12)</strong> divisions. 
            About 50 to 60 kids signed up, and while turnout wasn‚Äôt massive, the energy on the field was unforgettable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We secured a few small sponsors, organized game schedules, set up volunteer referees, and coordinated with parents ‚Äî all while balancing our own studies and responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was far from perfect, but it was a start. And the impact was real: kids found community, parents expressed gratitude, and we got excited to grow it further.
          </p><br>

          <h3>Leveling Up: Summer 2025 Plans</h3>
          <p>
            After a year of learning what worked (and what didn‚Äôt), we doubled down on our mission. 
            This year‚Äôs league ‚Äî running <strong>July 11, 12, and 13</strong> ‚Äî is already shaping up to be much bigger and better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs changed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>üí¨ <strong>Improved Marketing:</strong> We promoted through social media, community boards, and schools</li>
            <li>‚öΩ <strong>Over 200 Registered Participants:</strong> Up from ~60 last year ‚Äî 3x growth</li>
            <li>ü§ù <strong>New Sponsors:</strong> We secured support from local businesses, boosting our resources and prizes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Due to overwhelming demand and limited volunteer resources, we decided to focus solely on the <strong>Junior Division (Grades 1‚Äì6)</strong> this July.
            But we‚Äôre actively planning to bring back the <strong>Senior Division (Grades 7‚Äì12)</strong> later this summer.
          </p><br>

          <h3>What I Learned as a Co-Founder</h3>
          <p>
            Organizing a community sports league may not involve software, but it has taught me just as much about engineering ‚Äî especially the human kind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Scheduling games, teams, volunteers, and venues all required careful planning</li>
            <li><strong>Team Leadership:</strong> Delegating roles, solving conflicts, and motivating others taught me to lead under pressure</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Weather changes, last-minute dropouts, or field conflicts ‚Äî we handled them all in real time</li>
            <li><strong>Community Impact:</strong> Seeing the joy on kids‚Äô faces made the long hours worth it. That‚Äôs the kind of work that stays with you</li>
          </ul><br>

          <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
          <p>
            Our dream is to make this an <strong>annual community event</strong> that brings together families, kids, and local leaders through sport.
            We want to offer mentorship, coaching, and even scholarships in future editions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, this experience showed me that <strong>leadership isn‚Äôt limited to a profession ‚Äî it‚Äôs about action</strong>. 
            Whether I'm building an app or organizing a soccer league, I want to keep creating things that bring people together.
          </p><br>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Co-founding this soccer league with my brother and his friend has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
            It reminded me why we build things in the first place ‚Äî to serve people, inspire growth, and leave a positive mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you‚Äôre thinking of starting something ‚Äî a league, a club, a project ‚Äî <strong>start small, stay consistent, and grow with your community</strong>. That‚Äôs what we did.
