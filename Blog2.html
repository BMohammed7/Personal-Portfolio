          <div class="divider ltr"></div>

          <h2>Applying Engineering Concepts in the Real World</h2><br>

          <h3>Introduction: Beyond the Classroom</h3>
          <p>
            When I started my Software Engineering journey at <span class="colored">Ontario Tech University</span>, most of my time was spent learning theory — from data structures and discrete math to digital systems and architecture. 
            While important, I kept asking myself: <em>When will I actually use this?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t until I started building real projects, working with teams, and stepping into internships that I understood how theory transforms into practical engineering solutions. 
            This blog reflects how I’ve learned to apply abstract concepts to solve real problems — and how that has shaped the way I think as an engineer.
          </p><br>

          <h3>Building the Foundation: Cashier Receipt Printer</h3>
          <p>
            The first project where theory met reality was my <strong>Cashier Receipt Printer</strong> built in Java using OOP principles. 
            It may sound simple — calculate totals and print receipts — but the process taught me more than I expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used inheritance and encapsulation to keep the code clean and modular. I also had to account for edge cases like tax rounding errors and item-based discounts.
            When a bug caused totals to miscalculate, I spent hours tracing method calls. That experience helped me understand the <strong>importance of planning and debugging — not just coding.</strong>
          </p><br>

          <h3>Engineering in Action: Library Management System</h3>
          <p>
            Next came the <strong>Library Management System</strong>, a group project where we used <strong>HashMaps and Binary Trees</strong> to build a book search and lending system.
            Here, my biggest takeaway wasn’t technical — it was learning to think like a software engineer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How do we optimize search efficiency?</li>
            <li>What data structure fits the use case best?</li>
            <li>How do we collaborate without breaking the build?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I contributed core features, worked through merge conflicts, and presented the final product. 
            I began to understand that <strong>software engineering is equal parts logic, design, and collaboration.</strong>
          </p><br>

          <h3>Design Meets Function: Restaurant Website</h3>
          <p>
            My favorite full-stack project was the <strong>Restaurant Website</strong>, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Figma. 
            For the first time, I wasn’t just thinking like a developer — I had to think like a user.
          </p>
          <p>
            I collaborated on designing a responsive UI in Figma and coded interactive front-end elements. 
            We added a SQL-backed database for storing dynamic menu content and customer reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me that <strong>good software isn’t just functional — it must be accessible, intuitive, and responsive.</strong>
          </p><br>

          <h3>Teaching Code, Learning Empathy: Programming Camp</h3>
          <p>
            During the summer, I coordinated a two-week <strong>Programming Camp</strong> where I taught C++ and Java to local youth.
            This wasn’t just about syntax — it was about breaking down logic for students seeing code for the first time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I simplified concepts using real-life analogies</li>
            <li>Guided students through small projects and debugging</li>
            <li>Encouraged creativity in how they solved problems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Teaching taught me more than I expected — especially patience and clarity. 
            It also showed me how much I had grown — from learning code to helping others build it.
          </p><br>

          <h3>Stepping Into the Industry: Internship Experience</h3>
          <p>
            At <strong>My Homework Rewards</strong>, I worked as a Web Developer Intern, building an educational notes platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used responsive design techniques with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and collaborated with the content team to organize notes in a clean UI.
            We constantly tested layouts, received feedback from users, and made improvements in sprints.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was my first time applying concepts like <strong>version control, component design, and deployment</strong> in a real business environment — and it confirmed that this is exactly the kind of work I want to keep doing.
          </p><br>

          <h3>Core Lessons from My Journey</h3>

          <h3>✅ 1. Theory is the Toolkit</h3>
          <p>
            Concepts like recursion, trees, and normalization seemed abstract until I applied them in real projects. Now, I see theory as my toolkit for solving practical problems.
          </p>

          <h3>✅ 2. Communication Is a Core Skill</h3>
          <p>
            Whether I’m leading a team or collaborating in a sprint, the ability to explain ideas clearly is just as important as writing efficient code.
          </p>

          <h3>✅ 3. Learn by Doing</h3>
          <p>
            Every internship, group project, and personal build has taught me something lectures never could. 
            <strong>Action builds experience. Mistakes build confidence.</strong>
          </p><br>

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            As I enter third year, I’m excited to explore systems programming, backend optimization, and real-time infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is simple: <strong>keep learning by solving real problems with smart code.</strong>
          </p><br>
