          <h2>What I Learned Beyond the Code</h2><br>

          <h3>Starting the Journey</h3>
          <p>
            Like many students, I often wondered what working in the tech industry would actually feel like. Would it be stressful? Would I be ready?
            In January 2025, I got the chance to find out when I joined <strong>My Homework Rewards</strong> as a <strong>Web Developer Intern</strong>.
            This was my first official internship ‚Äî and while I was nervous, I was more excited to finally apply what I had been learning in school to something real.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next four months, I worked on a live educational platform, collaborated with a team, solved design problems, and learned what being part of a professional software project truly means.
          </p><br>

          <h3>Project Overview: Building an Educational Web Platform</h3>
          <p>
            My primary task was to build and maintain an online system to display and organize <strong>Data Management notes</strong> for students.
            This involved front-end development using:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML & CSS</strong> for structure and styling</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity and responsiveness</li>
            <li>Version control tools like Git for team collaboration</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I worked closely with the content team to ensure notes were presented clearly and could be accessed easily across different devices. 
            I also had to make sure the layout remained consistent and visually clean as content grew over time.
          </p><br>

          <h3>Challenges I Faced (And Overcame)</h3>
          <p>
            Every day brought a new learning curve. From responsive design to team communication, I had to adapt quickly. A few key challenges included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Design Alignment:</strong> Making sure UI elements matched the intended layout across browsers and screen sizes.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Learning to collaborate using Git and pushing clean, reviewed commits without breaking the project.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Balancing daily bug fixes with long-term feature planning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These challenges helped me grow. I learned how to troubleshoot, ask better questions, and most importantly ‚Äî stay calm and focused when things didn‚Äôt work right away.
          </p><br>

          <h3>Lessons Beyond the Screen</h3>
          <p>
            While I joined as a developer, I walked away with lessons that extended beyond writing code:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Communication Matters:</strong> Whether it was giving a project update or receiving design feedback, clear communication made everything smoother.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration is Key:</strong> Everyone on the team had a role ‚Äî and when we worked together, we moved faster and produced better results.</li>
            <li><strong>Details Make the Difference:</strong> Pixel spacing, color tones, loading speed ‚Äî small things had big impact on user experience.</li>
          </ul><br>

          <h3>Highlights of the Experience</h3>
          <p>
            There were plenty of little moments that stood out:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Seeing students use and benefit from the site I helped build</li>
            <li>Implementing my first responsive feature from scratch</li>
            <li>Receiving positive feedback during a demo presentation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Those moments made me realize ‚Äî this wasn‚Äôt just a learning opportunity. It was the start of something bigger: my contribution to real-world tech.
          </p><br>

          <h3>How It Shaped Me as a Developer</h3>
          <p>
            This internship helped me shift from being just a ‚Äústudent of code‚Äù to a developer who understands <strong>users, teams, and systems</strong>.
            It sharpened my problem-solving, improved my communication, and gave me a real taste of software delivery in a professional setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of all, it gave me confidence ‚Äî confidence that I have the skills, mindset, and drive to succeed in this field.
          </p><br>

          <h2>What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
          <p>
            With this experience under my belt, I‚Äôm more motivated than ever to take on bigger challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is simple: <strong>keep building, keep learning, and keep growing.</strong>
          </p><br>
